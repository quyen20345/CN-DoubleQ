"""
This module defines the data schemas for payloads stored in Qdrant.
Using Pydantic models here is highly recommended to ensure data consistency.

Example:

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional

class DocumentPayload(BaseModel):
    content: str
    source: str
    page_number: Optional[int] = None
    doc_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique ID for the source document")

Using such schemas would help validate data before it's sent to the vector store.
